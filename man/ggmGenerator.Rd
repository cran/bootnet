\title{
Generates a function that simulates data from the Gaussian graphical model (GGM)
}
\description{
Generates data given a partial correlation network. Data can be made ordinal by using a threshold model with equally spaced thresholds.
}
\usage{
ggmGenerator(ordinal = FALSE, nLevels = 4, skewFactor = 1, type =
                   c("uniform", "random"), missing = 0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ordinal}{
Logical, should ordinal data be generated?
}
  \item{nLevels}{
Number of levels used in ordinal data.
}
  \item{skewFactor}{
How skewed should ordinal data be? 1 indicates uniform data and higher values increase skewedness.
}
  \item{type}{
Should thresholds for ordinal data be sampled at random or determined uniformly?
}
  \item{missing}{
Proportion of data that should be simulated to be missing.
