Changes in version 0.4:
  - estimateNetwork now accepts a custom estimation function using the argument 'fun'
  - Reworked default sets as functions!
    - This makes it easier to change common arguments, such as the EBIC tuning parameter
    - See the following functions for details:
        - bootnet_EBICglasso
        - bootnet_IsingFit
  - The corStability function now has a greatly improved output
  - Default set "IsingLL" has been renamed to "IsingSampler"
  - Default set "mgm" is now supported
  - labels argument is now supported in difference plots
  - Quantile now uses type = 6, this makes CIs slightly wider and therefore the difference test slightly more conservative
  
  
Changes in version 0.3:
	- Eiko Fried joined the author list
	- Added 'estimateNetwork' function, allowing one to estimate the network structure 
	  from within bootnet
		- The plot method will run qgraph on the estimated network structure
		- The qgraph function getWmat can now be applied to networks estimated in bootnet. 
		  Allowing one to use, e.g., centralityPlot on a network estimated with 
		  'estimateNetwork'
	- Added 'differenceTest' function to test for significant differences between edge 
	  weights and centrality indices
	- Added 'corStability' to compute the CS-coefficient as described in our paper:
			- Epskamp, S., Borsboom, D., & Fried, E. I. (2016). Estimating psychological 
			  networks and their accuracy: a tutorial paper. arXiv preprint, 
			  arXiv:1604.08462.
	- The plot method now supports 'plot = "difference"', to make plots of significant 
	  differences between edge-weights and centralities
	- New default sets:
			- "huge"
			- "adalasso"
	- 'nCores' argument added to bootnet to use parallel computing
	- bootnet print methods now print a list of relevant references on the network 
	  estimation procedure used
	- When EBICglasso is used as default set, variables that are made ordinal are now 
	  printed only when estimating the first network
	- Updated CITATION such that citation("bootnet") now references the pre-print
	- Bootnet now gives a message on loading that it is BETA software
	- Added 'statistics' argument to bootnet. Now, distance and length are not stored by 
	  default
	- Several minor bugfixes
